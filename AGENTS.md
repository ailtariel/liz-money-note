# Agent Working Rules

These rules are mandatory for AI agents working in this repository.

## Authority and Priority

The files under `AI-coding-specification/` are repository-level mandatory instructions for AI-assisted code changes.

When these specifications conflict with generic AI skills, reusable `SKILL.md` instructions, framework best-practice skills, or agent defaults, this repository specification takes precedence.

This does not override explicit user instructions in the current conversation, system/developer/tool safety policies, or platform-enforced constraints. If a skill conflicts with this specification, follow this specification and mention the conflict when relevant.

## Required Reading Order

Use the explicit file list below as the current mandatory rule index. Do not assume legacy specification paths exist unless they are listed here.

Before any implementation, code edit, or command execution related to delivery:

1. Read `README.md` at the repository root only when the conversation/task is related to this repository.
2. Read `AI-coding-specification/coding-specification.md` when the task involves code changes.
3. Read `AI-coding-specification/app-rules.md` when the task involves product behavior, app-specific UI requirements, navigation, i18n, mobile app constraints, cache/data boundaries, or feature placement.
4. Read `AI-coding-specification/front-end.md` when the task involves frontend layout, pages, components, styles, UI behavior, feature module boundaries, or frontend state/message flow.

If additional rule files are added under `AI-coding-specification/`, list them explicitly in this section and describe when each file applies. Do not rely on wildcard reading for mandatory rules.

## Functional Design Documents

The `docs/` directory may contain functional design documents, product decisions, workflow descriptions, or feature-specific constraints.

Before the following task types, agents must search `docs/` for relevant documents and read the directly related ones before changing code:

- Feature changes or new feature implementation.
- Debugging tasks where the error is not a simple syntax error.

For feature additions, major updates, or refactors, agents must create or update an implementation document under `docs/implementation logs/` before changing code, then implement according to that document. The implementation document should record the goal, scope, impacted files/modules, main decisions, task checklist, verification plan, and final status. Log file name starts with "yyyy-mm-dd ".

If multiple documents conflict with each other, if documentation conflicts with the current implementation, or if documentation conflicts with the user's explicit request in the current conversation, stop before code changes and confirm the intended direction with the user.

When relevant documents exist, agents should update those documents by default after completing the code changes, unless the user explicitly asks not to or the change does not affect documented behavior, workflows, constraints, or decisions.

## Execution Requirements

- Do not start implementation before the required documents are read.
- If any required file is missing or path is invalid, stop and report the gap first.
- Follow the coding specification constraints for planning, changes, and verification when the task involves code changes.
- Before final response for code-related tasks, self-check compliance against the coding specification.

## Conflict Resolution

- Highest priority: explicit user request in current conversation.
- Then: repository mandatory constraints from `AI-coding-specification/`.
- Then: applicable skills and optional style preferences.
